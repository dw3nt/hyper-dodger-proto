# Hyper Dodger Prototype
A simple project that is just me trying to expand my skills by working to take those first few steps away from tutorials.

You can control a simple character at the bottom of the screen and have to dodge raining projectiles. Movement of all objects are along a track though.

The goal is to keep everything simple, including the graphics, but to experiment with juicing them up a bit with simple animations. Like modifying scale to give a fast moving object a squish effect.

This is just for my own personal experience and education, and hopefully you can learn some lessons from my work too.
